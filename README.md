## Desktop Images

I'm putting all of the desktop backgrounds onto GitHub so I can see how
they change over time as I find new ones, and learn to hate older ones.
It isn't a small repository (120MB) but connection speeds are fast nowadays!

I run OSX and rotate my desktop every 15 minutes by adding the folder to
System Preferences > Desktop & Screen Saver.

## Example Image

## Credits

I cannot claim any of the fame due the people who created these wonderful images.
